# Object Inheritance: Super

```python
class Furniture:
  def build(self):
    print("Your furniture is being built")
```

We have a parent class `Furniture` and a subclass `Table`. In the `Table` class,
we want to be able to call `build()` and have it print "You have chosen a table"
followed by "Your furniture is being built". Which code block achieves this?
Choose the **best** option in terms of using inheritance to avoid code
duplication while achieving the desired functionality.

## Correct

```python
class Table(Furniture):
  def build(self):
    print("You have chosen a table")
    super().build()
```

> Yes! If `Table` inherits from `Furniture` we can use the
> `Furniture build()`method by calling `super().build()` after running whatever
> extra functionality we need to run first.

## Incorrect

```python
class Table(Furniture):
  def build(self):
    super().build()
    print("You have chosen a table")
```

> Almost. In which order will the strings print? How can we make them print in
> the correct order?

## Incorrect

```python
class Table:
  def build(self):
    print("You have chosen a table")
    print("Your furniture is being built")
```

> Not quite. While this will achieve what we want, we have repeated ourselves.
> What can we do instead to DRY up our code and ensure the strings print in the
> correct order?

## Incorrect

```python
class Table(Furniture):
  def build(self):
    print("You have chosen a table")
    print("Your furniture is being built")
```

> Not quite. While this will achieve what we want, we have repeated ourselves
> and we've also overwritten the parent's method. What can we do instead to DRY
> up our code and ensure the strings print in the correct order?

## Incorrect

I don't know.
