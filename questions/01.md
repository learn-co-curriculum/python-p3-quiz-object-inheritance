# Object Inheritance: Fundamentals

We have a `Computer` class and would like to declare `Laptop` as a subclass
of`Computer`. Which syntax should we use?

## Correct

```python
class Laptop(Computer):
  pass
```

> Yes! We use the _less than_ symbol followed by the name of the parent class to
> specify that `Laptop` inherits from `Computer`.

## Incorrect

```python
class Laptop:
  pass
```

> This code declares the Laptop class but it doesn't cause the Laptop class to
> inherit from Computer. How can we make that happen? What's missing?

## Incorrect

```python
class Computer(Laptop):
  pass
```

> This would actually declare the `Computer` class and cause it to inherit
> from`Laptop`. How can we declare the `Laptop` class and make it inherit
> from`Computer` instead?

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
