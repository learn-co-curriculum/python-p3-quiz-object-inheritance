# Object Inheritance: Fundamentals

```python
class Computer:

  def __init__ (self, name, ram, hd):
    self.name = name
    self.ram_amount = ram
    self.hd_size = hd

  def calculate(self):
    return "Crunching numbers!"
```

To overwrite an inherited method from `Computer`, which syntax should be used?

## Correct

```python
class Laptop(Computer):
  def calculate(self):
    return "Processing mathematics!"
```

> Perfect! We declare the method with the same name inside the subclass and then
> write our code.

## Incorrect

```python
class Laptop:
  def calculate(self):
    return "Processing mathematics!"
```

> Laptop is being declared, but it isn't inheriting from a parent class. How do we
> fix this?

## Incorrect

I don't know.
