# Object Inheritance: Fundamentals

Consider the following code:

```ruby
class DailyRoutine:
  def morning(self):
    print("coffee")
    print("shower")

class MondayRoutine(DailyRoutine):
  def morning(self):
    print("jog")
    print("coffee")
    print("shower")
```

We want the `morning` method in the `MondayRoutine` class to add to the parent
class's functionality, rather than completely overwrite it. How do we do this in
a way that doesn't duplicate so much code?

## Correct

Use `super().morning()` in MondayRoutine`morning()` method.

> Correct! We can call `super()` anywhere we want in the method to call the
> parent's method, like so:
> 
> ```ruby
> class MondayRoutine(DailyRoutine): def morning(self):
>     print("jog")
>     super().morning()
> ```

## Incorrect

Use `super()` in the `MondayRoutine` class.
